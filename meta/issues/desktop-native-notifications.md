# Desktop app: native notifications

## Summary

Report: "desktop notifications not supported" in the Linux AppImage. The
desktop app uses the web view's Notification API: WebKitGTK asks the app
for permission (we don't answer: refused), Apple's WKWebView has no web
notifications at all, WebView2 (Windows) has them. Use native
notifications (tauri-plugin-notification) on all three; the web client
uses them when it runs in the desktop app.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Pure functions for which notifier is used (desktop app or browser) and
  the permission state, with tests.
- Settings switch works in the desktop app (asks the OS where needed).
- A click brings the app to the front and opens the chat where the
  platform reports clicks; else it only brings the app forward.
- Manual check: macOS build here; Linux and Windows by users.

## Linux follow-up (2026-10-19)

A Linux user's notification (AppImage): broken icon (the icon is passed by
theme name, which an AppImage does not install) and an empty button (the
click "default" action has no label, and their notification server shows
actions as buttons). Use a PNG file path for the icon; give the action a
label or leave it out where it shows as a button. Check with real
notification servers in podman (e.g. dunst, xfce4-notifyd, GNOME Shell if
feasible) under Xvfb, with screenshots.

Closed 2026-10-27: implemented (see git log); not every platform was checked on a real device.
